# PocketBase Zod Migration Package

This is the main package for the PocketBase Zod Migration library. The source code has been moved to this `package/` folder to create a more organized monorepo structure.

## Structure

- `src/` - TypeScript source code
- `dist/` - Built output (generated by tsup)
- `package.json` - Package configuration and dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `tsup.config.ts` - Build configuration
- `vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting configuration
- `nodemon.json` - Development server configuration
- `.npmignore` - Files to exclude from npm package

## Development

From the root directory, you can run:

```bash
# Build the package
yarn build

# Run tests
yarn test

# Start development mode
yarn dev

# Format code
yarn format

# Lint code
yarn lint
```

All commands are proxied through the root package.json to this workspace.

## Publishing

The package is published from this directory. The root `.npmignore` excludes this folder from the root package, and this folder has its own package configuration for publishing to npm.
